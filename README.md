## About
This repository is a collection of Python scripts and solutions to problems that I have solved as part of my ITI training. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including:
- Basic Python syntax and data structures
- Algorithms and data structures
- Problem-solving techniques
- Practical applications of Python

The goal of this repository is to document my progress, share solutions, and help others who are learning Python and problem-solving.
